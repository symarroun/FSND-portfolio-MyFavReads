# MyPortfolio Project for Udacity FENanoDegree

## About
The project provided me with a Mockup Design in a PDF and I had to code the design and ensure it is responsive, then cutomize it to my desire. Thus, I decided to create my customized page as My Favorite Books Page.

## The Framework
### Bootstrap
Bootstrap is used to create a grid-based webpage.
I have Included the full package of bootstrap in case anyone want to fork or clone my project and take it further.

#### JavaScript & jQuery
The webpage is interactive as you can click on each book cover and more information about the book will pop-up. This was done via the JavaScript modals with jQuery functionalities that come bundled with bootstrap.

## How to Open My Page
1. Download the files
2. Open the index.html file with your favorite browser

## End Note
Hope you enjoy reading my favorite books as much as I did.
